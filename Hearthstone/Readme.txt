To start the game, you need to run the controller in the engine package.
Upon running the controller, you will be asked to choose the 2 heroes that will play, by clicking on their corresponding image.

The game will then start.

In the south of the window, are the cards in the hand of the current hero.
In the center if the window is the field, which is divided to 2 rows, the minions of the opponent on top, and the minions of the current hero below them.
On the right side of the window are the two heroes, the opponent and below him the current hero, next to them is the "End Turn" button, below it is a button that triggers the Hero Power, and is displayed as an image of the Hero power of the current hero.

To check the details of the minions such as HP/Mana cost/Rarity... you just hover with the mouse over that minion.

The minions on the field have the Attack and current HP on the image of the minion actively update according to their values, so that they can be seen all the time, without the need to even hover the mouse. 
This is also implemented for the heroes, where you can see the HP and current mana at all times, to see the rest of the details just hover the mouse over their images.

To play a minion from hand, just click on the image of the card you want to play.

To attack with a minion, just click on the image of the attacker, from your field, then click on a target minion from the opponent field, or click on the opponent hero image to trigger the attack.

To cast a spell, similarly click on the image of the spell from your hand. If it doesn't take a target, for example AOESpells, their effect will take place instantly, if they take a target, such as Hero and Minion Target spells, a pop up will appear asking you to pick a target, you choose one by clicking on the image of the target, minion or hero. If you choose a wrong target, like a minion for a Hero Target Spell, a pop up will ask you to choose the target.

If after you choose an attacker, or you click on a targeted spell and you change your mind, you can deselect the card by either clicking on it again or pressing the "Esc" key on the keyboard. In case of attacking, if you choose a minion from your field, then click on a second one from your field, the first one is deselected and the second minion is set as attacker. The selected card has a border around it and appears beveled when you hover over it.

To end your turn, you simply click on the "End Turn" button, where the opponent will be the current hero and will be placed on the bottom of the window. 

If your hand is full and you draw a card, the burnt card is displayed in place of the field for 2 seconds.

When playing a minion, if its Sleeping, the image of the card will be black and white, if a minion has divine shield, a color filter layer will be on top of the card. 

**NB: When clicking on a card or targeting a hero, it is recommended that you keep the mouse cursor fully on the image of the object you wish to click on. Pressing on a target, then moving the cursor away, then releasing the click will result in this click not being detected. You will also hear auditory queues whenever the attack has happened or the spell is cast.
